Make msh2vtu work on 3D mesh from Gmsh-Python tutorial t3 and test also on further tutorial examples

Verify domain cell numbering of mixed domains (e.g. tri and quad), i.e. cell numbering in node connectivity matches with vtu-file (and thus OGS), ideally implement OOP style (node_connectivity class) 

Add automatic tests, e.g. 2D tri, quad and 3D tetra, with and without --ogs option

Enable higher order elements (replace current workflow: gmsh, msh2vtu_original, createQuadraticMesh, msh2vtu_extract); 

Try other file formats (xdmf, ...)

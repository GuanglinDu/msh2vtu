warning if more nodes than domain
add connectivity only to domain nodes
error if orphaned node is accessed

Extract physical groups for 1D (also boundaries)

Try msh2vtu on further Gmsh tutorial examples

Verify domain cell numbering of mixed domains (e.g. tri and quad), i.e. cell numbering in node connectivity matches with vtu-file (and thus OGS), ideally implement OOP style (node_connectivity class), possibly try to use remove_lower_dimensional_cells() for domain or copy cells/cell_data instead of dicts 

Try other file formats (xdmf, ...)
